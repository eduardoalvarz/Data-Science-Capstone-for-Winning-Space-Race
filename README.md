# Data Science Capstone for Winning Space Race

## Overview
The "Data Science Capstone for Winning the Space Race" GitHub repository offers an immersive exploration into the competitive field of commercial space travel. 

This project targets the recent shift towards affordable space exploration, with companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and particularly SpaceX, leading the charge. SpaceX has notably reduced launch costs through innovations like the reusable Falcon 9 rocket. 

This capstone challenges you to assume the role of a data scientist at Space Y, a burgeoning company aiming to rival SpaceX. Your mission is to analyze launch data, craft insightful dashboards, and employ machine learning to predict and potentially reduce the costs of space launches.

## Curriculum
This capstone project encompasses a comprehensive curriculum designed to equip you with the skills needed to analyze and predict aspects of commercial space launches. The project is divided into several key components:

### Data Collection
- **API Integration**: Learn to harness APIs for real-time data on space launches, including technical specifications, launch outcomes, and cost metrics.
- **Web Scraping Techniques**: Master the art of extracting vital information from various web sources to supplement your data analysis.

### Data Preparation and Analysis
- **Data Wrangling**: Dive deep into data cleaning and preprocessing to transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - **Using SQL**: Develop SQL queries to perform structured data exploration, identifying patterns and insights.
  - **Through Visualization**: Employ powerful visualization libraries in Python to bring your data to life, highlighting key trends and anomalies.

### Advanced Data Presentation
- **Interactive Dashboard Creation with Plotly Dash**: Build dynamic and interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data through different lenses, enhancing decision-making processes.
- **Geospatial Analysis with Folium**: Utilize Folium for mapping launch sites and analyzing geographic patterns in launch success rates and other factors.

### Predictive Modeling
- **Machine Learning for Prediction**: Design and train a machine learning model to forecast the likelihood of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage landing successfully, a critical factor in reducing launch costs.

## Project Implementation
- **Scenario Overview**: The project sets the stage with the current state of commercial space exploration, emphasizing the role of reusable rockets in reducing costs. You will explore SpaceX's innovative approach to launches, specifically focusing on the Falcon 9.
- **Role Playing**: As a data scientist for Space Y, you're tasked with dissecting SpaceX's success to aid your company in competing within the space industry. This involves data gathering, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
- **Technical Focus**: The project is heavily rooted in Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, Plotly Dash for dashboard creation, Folium for geospatial analysis, and Scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Project Goals
By the end of this capstone, you will have:
- Developed a solid understanding of the data science workflow, from data collection to predictive modeling.
- Gained practical experience in applying Python and its libraries to real-world data science problems.
- Created a portfolio-worthy project demonstrating your ability to extract insights from complex datasets and predict outcomes using machine learning.

## Final Deliverables
- A comprehensive report detailing your methodology, analysis, and findings.
- A GitHub repository containing all code, datasets, and documentation for the project.
- An interactive dashboard showcasing your analysis and predictions.
- A presentation summarizing the key aspects of your project, suitable for a technical and non-technical audience.
