# Data Science Capstone for Winning Space Race

## Overview
Welcome to the "Data Science Capstone for Winning Space Race" GitHub repository. 

This project is designed to immerse you in the world of commercial space travel, focusing on the groundbreaking achievements of companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and SpaceX. With the dawn of affordable space travel, understanding the dynamics of rocket launches, especially the cost-saving strategies through reusable rocket stages, becomes crucial. SpaceX has revolutionized this domain by making rocket launches more economical, primarily through the reuse of the Falcon 9's first stage. 

This capstone project aims to leverage data science to predict the reusability of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage, thereby estimating the cost of a launch. You'll play the role of a data scientist at Space Y, a new company aiming to compete with SpaceX, using your skills to gather data, create insightful dashboards, and predict launch costs.

## Topics Covered
- **Data Collection API**: Utilize APIs to gather data on space launches, focusing on parameters critical for analysis.
- **Data Collection with Web Scraping**: Extract data from web sources that are essential for understanding the space launch landscape.
- **Data Wrangling**: Clean and prepare the collected data for analysis, ensuring it's accurate and usable.
- **EDA with SQL**: Conduct exploratory data analysis using SQL to uncover patterns and insights from the data.
- **EDA with Visualization**: Use various visualization tools to explore the data further and uncover hidden trends.
- **Interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash**: Develop interactive dashboards to display your findings dynamically, making the data accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium**: Utilize Folium for geospatial analysis, offering a geographical perspective on launch sites and their outcomes.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Build a machine learning model to predict whether the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully, influencing the cost estimation of launches.

## Project Scenario and Overview
The commercial space age has arrived, with companies striving to make space travel accessible to everyone. Among these, SpaceX stands out by providing cost-effective solutions through reusable rockets, particularly the Falcon 9. This project will delve into SpaceX's operations to understand the factors that contribute to the successful landing of the Falcon 9's first stage and its impact on launch costs.

As a data scientist for Space Y, you'll collect and analyze data on SpaceX and similar companies, create visual analytics to share with your team, and develop a machine learning model to predict the reusability of the Falcon 9's first stage. This capstone project is not only about analyzing data but also about applying your findings to compete in the burgeoning space industry.

This project will primarily use Python for data collection, wrangling, analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks. Through this capstone, you'll gain hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to real-world scenarios, preparing you for a career in this exciting field.

## Note
This repository is structured to guide you through the process of tackling a complex data science project from start to finish. Each topic is designed to build upon the previous one, culminating in a comprehensive analysis and a predictive model. We encourage you to explore the data, ask your own questions, and share your insights with the community.

Welcome aboard the journey to the final frontier through the lens of data science!
